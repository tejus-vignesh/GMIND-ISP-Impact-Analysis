# GMIND Dataset Configuration
# Defines train, validation, and test data splits
#
# Recommended Models for Training:
# - YOLO: yolov12m (latest, best balanced) or yolov12n/yolov12s/yolov12l/yolov12x
# - Transformer: rtdetr-l (real-time transformer) or dino (via MMDetection)

data:
  # Root directory of GMIND dataset
  # Examples: Windows: "H:/GMIND", WSL: "/mnt/h/GMIND", Linux: "/path/to/GMIND"
  root: "/home/tejus/Workspace/GMIND-ISP-Impact-Analysis/GMIND"  # UPDATE THIS PATH to your GMIND dataset location
  
  # Sensor to use
  # Options: "FLIR3.2", "FLIR8.9", "CCTV", "Thermal", "EB", "Drone"
  sensor: "FLIR8.9"
  
  # Frame sampling
  # Use every 10th frame (1Hz instead of 30Hz) to get more frames
  frame_stride: 10
  max_frames_per_video: null  # Max frames per video (null = all frames)

# Train/Validation/Test splits
# 
# Split strategy:
# - Training: All of PedestrianInteractionSet (both /1 and /2), 80% of OutlierSet/1, 80% of UrbanJunctionSet/1
# - Validation: 20% of OutlierSet/1 and 20% of UrbanJunctionSet/1 (remaining portions)
# - Test: All of OutlierSet/2 and UrbanJunctionSet/2 (for final metrics evaluation)


train:
  sets:
    - "NightUrbanJunction"
  # Specify subdirectories for each set
  set_subdirs:
    "NightUrbanJunction": [2]
  # Use 80% of data for training
  percentage_split:
    "NightUrbanJunction/2": 0.7

validation:
  # Validation: Use remaining 20% of data
  sets:
    - "NightUrbanJunction"
  set_subdirs:
    "NightUrbanJunction": [2]
  # Start from 80% and use remaining 20%
  percentage_split_start:
    "NightUrbanJunction/2": 0.7
  percentage_split:
    "NightUrbanJunction/2": 0.2

test:
  # Use validation set as test for now (same 20% of data)
  sets:
    - "NightUrbanJunction"
  set_subdirs:
    "NightUrbanJunction": [2]
  percentage_split_start:
    "NightUrbanJunction/2": 0.9
